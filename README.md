An open-source Polygon CDK zkEVM L2 Validium monorepo

> I made this monorepo with all required submodules for launching a Layer-2 zkEVM validium on Polygon CDK. Since Polygon CDK uses closed-/semi-opensource docker infrastructure, I wanted to have a central repository from where you are able to build and extend a polygon cdk rollup/validium.
